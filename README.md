# toggle-slash extension for Visual Studio Code

An extension for Visual Studio Code, which toggle between slashes and backslashes, or alternatively adds additional slashes or backslashes.

This is largely inspired by https://github.com/skandasoft/toggle-slash, which does the same in the Atom editor.
